Notes on a vision for Kenya's sovereignity

*THE PROBLEM*
- 11.53% or 385.65B KES of 2024/2025 Kenyan budget is foreign receipt. this is too much. we need to show abundance and that we do not need foreign help for our economy to work. we can't budget for grants and foreign debt because it compromises our sovereignity and self-determinance. logically, we become controlled by these foreign receipts. instead, we should create procedures for how our country can become the disbursers of our created surpluses. as a good measure i think, around 2% or 79.72B($618M)  of gvt spending should be on foreign disbursements and furthering kenyan interests in east and central africa specifically countries with potential for high value partnerships with kenya, e.g. Congo Kinshasa ,Angola, and Uganda.

god, i love economics. it is like the final boss, especially macroeconomics and political economics.

i want to start replacing sharing out my thoughts(like the one above here and even this one) on twitter publicly with just writing them down in a buffer like this one here. after scrupulous reasoning then maybe will i be sharing.

one thing i didn't understand before was why gdp was being used in gvt docs very much instead of budget, but now i know better.  the gdp is the whole economy. the gvt budget is part of the gdp, like a small shop in the mall. but i think it is stupid when political economists use borrowing:gdp instead of borrowing:spending in government budget. because it makes it look small, yet is a big issue. 

- should we look at the money lenders as hostile people? well, when they gave us the money, they believed our sovereignity to be important and so thought we could manage it well. Well we have managed to get some good projects from debt financing, yes. but conspiratorial theories still remain. of course the saying: every rumor has some truth to it. but then, one of my most important convictions is maimed if i am to believe in conspiracy and choose to see ourselves as the victims of complex debt traps. i believe every good country acts for the best interests of their people. and that means creating more for the people. with debts, the gvt surplus gains interest when debted out. just recently, china's gdp is receiving $22B from foreign debt. how marvelous! i believe this should be the future for kenya if we are to make the kenyan identity great.

- giving out debt forces the country to be strategic. for example, if we go with my idea, we dish out $618M to the East African economy. but we are not just sending it in cash. no! the gvt or private companies create jobs for kenyans and send them out to East Africa to build infrastructure and businesses. logically, this forces the kenyan gvt to spend money on training competent personnel to solve these problems. in so doing, we thrive.

*another problem*
a mheshimiwa (probably): Loook man, your plan sounds good on paper. it is easier said than done.
a economist (probably): Shut up bro! we don't just have $600M+ to disburse out of the country.
treasury c/s (probably): good idea. but this year alone we have $590M in budget deficits!
the president (probably): bro, that is ambitious but slow and that will not get me re-elected within 3 years.
commoner (probably) : bro that is a good idea. i am all in.

me: you are all most probably right! but my goal here is to sell a vision! a new way of thinking about our economic situation. and for all intents and purposes, i don't have economics wisdom. i am writing this from a layman perspective of how a nation can start imperializing and reinstate the greatness of its people. this is all so we can start discussing on our debt situation and ways we can mitigate such.


is there even any 'WE' currently or am i just imagining things. i think i am just envisioning a 'WE' of kenyans working towards making our country prosperous.

- it is tiring to think that this is the kind of thing i will have to spend most of my life doing. i hope a lot of my fellow citizens and comrades will be able to see the vision i have and the bountiful inheritance that nature has endowed us with. a lot of our work will benefit our grandchildren and their progeny. but what if mine is just a farce and useless ramblings of a mad man? for sure, that would be bad? but what's good is that we will have set the vision so that if kenyans decide not to dream of achieving it, then it is their fault for choosing to remain enslaved and being treated subnormally like clinging and dependent losers.
