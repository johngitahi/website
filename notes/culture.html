      <p>This post contradicts what I previously proposed about normalizing <a href="../notes/history.html">positive histories</a>. But in retrospect, if we are to move forward, we must first acknowledge what we need to leave behind. I believe in the pseudoscience of associative powers, and lately, I’ve been reflecting on how our culture may be covertly trapping us in poverty.</p>

      <p>Hospitals lacking essential drugs and PPEs have been normalized—I know because I’ve worked in three referral hospitals during my clinical rotations. Public transport issues? Overcrowded matatus and buses—everyone accepts it. Poor public housing leading to sprawling slums. Dysfunctional values like jealousy, distrust, impunity, and laziness. These are everyday realities for Kenyans. Ugly sights, yet instead of confronting them, we gradually accept them until they become an unshakable status quo.</p>

      <p>At the heart of this culture lies <span class="highlight">systemic corruption</span>. But do we need to eradicate corruption first before progress? Given its deeply rooted complexities, that’s a long haul—we’re better off embedding solutions into the system as we go.</p>

      <p>As much as we cherish our culture, we must remember that most of our current solutions are temporary. That sambaza seat on your daily commute? A quick fix to a failing transport system. You accepting sitting on it is you accepting mediocrity. And years later, in retirement, you will find yourself on the same sambaza. Stagnant. Creation is our only liberation.</p>
